This is Team 12's Project: Moo...vies! Generator

## Objective:

Various movies are accessible all over the world by a wide range of viewers everyday. Movie-watchers internationally have access to a broad variety of films. There are thousands of movies to watch, which can be overwhelming for any eager watcher who is indecisive on what to indulge in for their own entertainment. Luckily, users can now generate their own movie(s) according to their preferences through our website called the “Moo…vies! Generator”.

This special website can generate a list of movies, according to a user’s selection in genres, dates, ratings, etc. A user of the website will be asked to answer a few questions, which helps in generating a helpful list of movies that the viewer can choose from. Features in the website include:
1) Opening Screen
2) Questions
3) Display Results

Languages that were implemented in the programming of this website includes HTML and CSS for the front-end, while it uses SQL and PHP for the back-end.

The dataset was obtained from IMDB.
